ScribbleDash: A Creative Drawing Application
We are building a mobile drawing application called ScribbleDash that focuses on freestyle drawing with a clean, intuitive interface.
App Overview
ScribbleDash is designed as a creative drawing platform where users can express their artistic abilities. In this initial milestone, you're focusing on establishing the core drawing functionality with a simple, uncluttered user experience.
The application's tagline captures its essence perfectly: "No app variants - just pure, unfiltered creativity!" Users can unleash their inner artist and draw freely on a canvas with the ability to undo mistakes and redo strokes.
